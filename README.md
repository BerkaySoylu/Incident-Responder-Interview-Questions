# Incident Responder Interview Questions

## What should you expect?

Below is a list of the topics on which questions can be asked in the interview.

## Pre-preparing

 - First, fully understand what kind of role you are applying for. Like if you're applying Security Analyst (Tier 1 Analyst) job, then you should already know what Security Analysts do or what difficulties SOC Analysts are having.
 - Make sure that you know about the company you are applying for. Are you going to give support to multiple companies at the same time or they are looking for internal SOC?
 - If you have any friend who is working at the company you're applying for, make a phone call and ask what kind of difficulties your friend is having.
 - Do not tell your salary expectation during the interview. Answer like: "I think my salary expectations are within your scale. In case of positive progress, I am open to your suggestions at the proposal stage."
 - Make sure you know the salary scale of the job you're applying. You can ask on Reddit.


## General Incident Response Interview Questions:

### What is an incident?

The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) defines a cyber incident as a breach of a system's security policy in order to affect its integrity or availability and/or the unauthorized access or attempted access to a system or systems; in line with the Computer Misuse Act. 

In general, an incident is a violation of computer security policies, acceptable use policies, or standard computer security practices. (NIST)
Examples of incidents are:
 - An attacker commands a botnet to send high volumes of connection requests to one of an
organization’s web servers, causing it to crash.
 - Users are tricked into opening a “quarterly report” sent via email that is actually malware;
running the tool has infected their computers and established connections with an external
host.

### What is incident handling - incident response?

Incident handling is the process of detecting and analyzing incidents and limiting the incident’s effect. For example, if an attacker breaks into a system through the Internet, the incident handling process should detect the security breach. Incident handlers will then analyze the data and determine how serious the attack is. The incident will be prioritized, and the incident handlers will take action to ensure that the progress of the incident is halted and that the affected systems return to normal operation as soon as possible.

### Can you explain the Incident Response Life Cycle and its key phases?

The NIST incident response lifecycle breaks incident response down into four main phases: Preparation; Detection and Analysis; Containment, Eradication, and Recovery; and Post-Event Activity.

### How do you prioritize and classify incidents based on their severity and impact?

Incidents can be classified based on severity, impact, and likelihood of occurrence. Prioritization should consider factors such as potential damage, criticality of affected systems, and regulatory requirements.

### What are the common sources of incident alerts?

Common sources include intrusion detection systems (IDS), security information and event management (SIEM) solutions, antivirus software, firewalls, and user reports.

### What are the common indicators of a security incident?

Common indicators include unusual network traffic patterns, unauthorized access attempts, unexpected system behavior, and malware infections.

### What is the difference between an incident and an event in the context of cybersecurity?

An event is any observable occurrence in a system or network, while an incident is an event that has a negative impact on the confidentiality, integrity, or availability of information or IT services.

### What is the difference between an indicator of compromise (IOC) and a signature in the context of cybersecurity?

An indicator of compromise (IOC) is any observable evidence or artifact that may indicate an ongoing or past security incident, such as suspicious network traffic patterns, unauthorized file modifications, or unusual system behavior. A signature is a specific pattern or characteristic associated with a known threat or vulnerability that can be used to detect and block malicious activity, often implemented in intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS).

### Explain the difference between proactive and reactive incident response strategies.

Proactive incident response involves implementing preventive measures and proactive monitoring to identify and mitigate security risks before they escalate into incidents. 
Reactive incident response, on the other hand, focuses on responding to security incidents after they have occurred, including detection, analysis, containment, eradication, and recovery activities.
